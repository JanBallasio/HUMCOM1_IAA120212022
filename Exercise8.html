                <p>It's Christmas, and there is so much to do, especially when your entire family is going on vacation. The McCallister family is headed to Paris to spend Christmas with family. Bratty eight year old Kevin McCallister (Macauley Culkin) gets into an argument with his older brother, Buzz, and is sent to bed early, wishing that his family would just disappear. Well, that's the thing about Christmas wishes - they have a magical tendency to come true. That night there is a power outage which re-sets all the appliances in the house, including the alarm clocks, which do not go off as planned. The family is left scrambling to make it to the airport in time to catch their flight accidentally leaving Kevin behind. His absence is not noticed until the plane is airborne, leaving his frantic parents trying desperately to book a flight home again as soon as they deplane in France.
                <br><br>
                Meanwhile, back at the McCallister home, Kevin thinks that his Christmas wish has come true when he realizes he is alone in the house. He does all of the things he is never allowed to do - bounces on the beds, uses Buzz's BB gun and eats junk food whilst watching gangster movies. However, he is also a little scared by Old Man Marley who lives next door because local myth tells it that the old man murdered his entire family years before; the appearance of him outside his house with a shovel makes Kevin very nervous. Then there is the matter of the Wet Bandits, Hal and Marv, who are in the middle of an inept, but determined, crime spree and are breaking into houses whilst people are away for the holidays.
                <br><br>
                Kevin overhears the bandits talking about breaking into the McCallister home on Christmas Eve, and as the man of the house in the absence of his father, he decides to stymie their efforts. He also runs into Old Man Marley watching a local choir performing in the church; they talk, and Kevin learns that the old man is actually very nice. He is watching the choir because his granddaughter is in it, and he doesn't get to see her anymore because he and his son had a big argument and no longer talk. Kevin advises him to reconcile with his son so that he can spend Christmas with his family. Kevin heads home after church and prepares to booby trap the house so that the bandits cannot break into it. He sprinkles broken tree ornaments that are made of glass underneath the windowsill so that when the men break in they will cut their feet; he also booby traps the cellar, causing Hal to break a tooth when a can of paint hits him in the face. They chase Kevin through the house and hang him on the towel hook behind the bathroom door when they catch him but he has already called 911. Kevin escapes the house with the burglars in hot pursuit, but Old Man Marley comes up behind them, knocking them out with a swing of his snow shovel, and taking Kevin home. The police arrive, and the burglars are arrested.
                <br><br>
                Kevin wakes up on Christmas morning hoping that his family will be home, but they are not, but he hears his mother open the front door and call his name. Kate McCallister has driven home with a performing band, squished tightly into the back of their RV, and is relieved to see her son again. Soon afterwards, the rest of the family, fresh from their flight from Paris, arrive. Even Buzz is pleased to see him. Kevin does not tell his family about his encounter with the Wet Bandits, but when his father finds the burglar's gold tooth on the floor he wonders what could be. Kevin sees Old Man Marley out of the window and sees that he has invited his son and the family over for Christmas; he watches as they reconcile and the old man greets his beloved granddaughter. The idyllic picture is interrupted as Buzz yells out to Kevin about the state of his room.</p>

                <p>Sean Boswell (Black) is an outsider who attempts to define himself as a hot-headed, underdog street racer. Although racing provides a temporary escape from an unhappy home and the superficial world around him, it has also made Sean unpopular with the local authorities. To avoid jail time, Sean is sent to live with his gruff, estranged father, a career military-man stationed in Tokyo.
                <br><br>
                Now officially a gaijin (outsider), Sean feels even more shut out in a land of foreign customs and codes of honor. But it doesn’t take long for him to find some action when a fellow American buddy, Twinkie (Bow Wow), introduces him to the underground world of drift racing. Sean’s simple drag racing gets replaced by a rubber-burning, automotive art form—with an exhilarating balance of speeding and gliding through a heart-stopping course of hairpin turns and switchbacks.
                <br><br>
                On his first time out drifting, Sean unknowingly takes on D.K., the “Drift King,” a local champ with ties to the Japanese crime machine Yakuza. Sean’s loss comes at a high price tag when he’s forced to work off the debt under the thumb of ex-pat, Han (Kang). Han soon welcomes Sean into this family of misfits and introduces him to the real principles of drifting. But when Sean falls for D.K.’s girlfriend, Neela (newcomer Kelley), an explosive series of events is set into motion, climaxing with an ultimate high stakes face off.

                <p>Vin Diesel and Paul Walker lead a reunion of returning all-stars from every chapter of the explosive franchise built on speed in "Fast Five." In this installment, former cop Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) partners with ex-con Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) on the opposite side of the law. Dwayne Johnson joins returning favorites Jordana Brewster, Chris "Ludacris" Bridges, Tyrese Gibson, Sung Kang, Gal Gadot, Matt Schulze, Tego Calderon and Don Omar for this ultimate high-stakes race.
                <br><br>
                Since Brian and Mia Toretto (Brewster) broke Dom out of custody, they've blown across many borders to elude authorities. Now backed into a corner in Rio de Janeiro, they must pull one last job in order to gain their freedom. As they assemble their elite team of top racers, the unlikely allies know their only shot of getting out for good means confronting the corrupt businessman who wants them dead. But he's not the only one on their tail.
                <br><br>
                Hard-nosed federal agent Luke Hobbs (Johnson) never misses his target. When he is assigned to track down Dom and Brian, he and his strike team launch an all-out assault to capture them. But as his men tear through Brazil, Hobbs learns he can't separate the good guys from the bad. Now, he must rely on his instincts to corner his prey... before someone else runs them down first.

                <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/jumanji/images/1/1b/Jumanji_2017_Poster.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20181023182751" alt="Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle" style="float:left;width:150px;height:150px;padding-right: 15px;padding-top: 0px;padding-left: 0px;padding-bottom: 0px;">  
                <p>In 1996, Brantford, New Hampshire, teenager Alex Vreeke receives Jumanji, which was previously disposed of by Alan Parrish and Sarah Whittle in 1969 [a], from his father who discovered it at the coast while jogging. Uninterested, Alex sets it aside, only to find it transformed into a video game cartridge later that night. Opting to play the game, he is suddenly sucked inside upon choosing a character. His disappearance results in his father becoming despondent and their home falling into disrepair.
                <br><br>
                Twenty-one years later, in 2017, four Brantford High School students – rebellious Martha Kaply, shallow Bethany Walker, awkward Spencer Gilpin, and athlete Anthony "Fridge" Johnson – are sent by Principal Bentley to clean the school's basement for detention – Bethany for talking on her phone during a quiz, Martha for saying the life of a gym teacher is not important in life , and Spencer and Fridge for the former writing the latter's essay assignment for him as it was considered cheating. Fridge discovers Alex's discarded video game system, which he and Spencer decide to play and encourage the girls to join them. Upon starting the game, they are sucked into Jumanji, landing in a jungle as their chosen characters – Spencer as muscular explorer and archaeologist Dr. Xander "Smolder" Bravestone; Fridge as diminutive zoologist Franklin "Mouse" Finbar; Martha as martial arts expert Ruby Roundhouse; and Bethany as male cartographer and paleontologist Professor Sheldon "Shelly" Oberon.
                <br><br>
                While coming to terms with their situation, the group find three marks on their arms denoting lives. Spencer theorizes that if they lose all three, they will die in real life. The group encounter the game's non-player character guide Nigel Billingsley who provides them with the game's narrative and their characters' backstories. The group learn that their goal is to end a curse on Jumanji, brought about by corrupt archaeologist Professor Russell Van Pelt after he stole a magical jewel called the "Jaguar's Eye" from its shrine and gained control of all the jungle's animals, casting a terrible curse upon Jumanji. Nigel hands Spencer the jewel, having stolen it from Van Pelt, and instructs the group to return it to a statue at the shrine and call out "Jumanji" to lift the curse and leave the game before driving off.
                <br><br>
                Coping with their avatars, their "weaknesses", Van Pelt's men, and Spencer and Fridge's animosity towards each other, the group encounter Alex operating the fifth avatar – pilot Jefferson "Seaplane" McDonough – who takes them to a treehouse that Alan Parrish built during his tenure in Jumanji after saving them from Van Pelt's men. Upon realizing his identity, the group is collectively shocked upon learning how long he has been trapped in the game, although Alex thought he'd only been there a few months. Now with a common goal, the group vows to help Alex return home with them.
                <br><br>
                Dealing with further problems while heading for the shrine, the group coordinate to overcome them. They eventually reach the shrine, but Van Pelt corners them. Working together, Fridge, Bethany, and Alex distract him while Spencer and Martha outmaneuver him with the game's mechanics, returning the jewel to the statue. Upon calling out Jumanji, the group destroy Van Pelt and, after sharing a handshake with Nigel, return to the real world.
                <br><br>
                Returning to the school basement, the foursome find Alex is not with them. While walking home, they unexpectedly find the Vreeke home restored and decorated for a Christmas family gathering. The group is greeted by Alex, now an adult, who explains that he managed to miraculously return to 1996, which allowed him to lead a married life with two children. He has a son named Andy and his daughter is named after Bethany, who revived him with one of her lives in the game.
                <br><br>
                The four students become friends after their experiences in the game, with Bethany becoming a better person, Spencer and Fridge patching things up, and Spencer starting a relationship with Martha. Later, they destroy the game by dropping a bowling ball they found earlier on it to prevent it from endangering anyone else.</p>

                <p>In 1996, Brantford, New Hampshire, teenager Alex Vreeke receives Jumanji, which was previously disposed of by Alan Parrish and Sarah Whittle in 1969 [a], from his father who discovered it at the coast while jogging. Uninterested, Alex sets it aside, only to find it transformed into a video game cartridge later that night. Opting to play the game, he is suddenly sucked inside upon choosing a character. His disappearance results in his father becoming despondent and their home falling into disrepair.
                    <br><br>
                    Two years after their previous adventures in Jumanji,[a] Spencer Gilpin, Anthony "Fridge" Johnson, Martha Kaply, and Bethany Walker go to separate colleges, but plan to meet up over Christmas break. The night before, Spencer, feeling despondent that his life isn't as glamorous as his friends', gets out Jumanji. When he doesn't show, his friends visit his mother's, and are greeted by Spencer's grandfather Eddie and Eddie's estranged friend and former business partner Milo Walker. Fridge, Martha, and Bethany realize he has gone into the game and they follow Spencer. Eddie and Milo are also sucked into the game inadvertently while Bethany is left behind.
                    <br><br>
                    Inside the game, Martha becomes an avatar named Ruby Roundhouse (whom she had been previously). Fridge becomes Professor Sheldon Oberon (who had been Bethany previously) while Eddie and Milo become Dr. Smolder Bravestone and Franklin "Mouse" Finbar (who were Spencer and Fridge previously).
                    <br><br>
                    After giving Eddie and Milo Jumanji's rules, they encounter non-player character Nigel Billingsley, the game guide, who reveals that Jumanji is suffering from a massive drought. To leave the game, they must end the drought by recovering a magical necklace known as the Falcon Heart, stolen by warlord and Bravestone’s rival Jurgen the Brutal. Meanwhile, Bethany, still out of the game and in the real world, finds Jumanji player Alex Vreeke for help.
                    <br><br>
                    Transported to a desert to pursue Jurgen, and narrowly escaping a herd of ostriches, they encounter Spencer, operating with a new avatar, Ming Fleetfoot, a skilled thief. Apologizing for their predicament, Spencer joins them.
                    <br><br>
                    While attempting to escape the desert, they face new challenges and problems, along with collecting a Jumanji Berry and discovering a pool of glowing green water that allows them to switch avatars. However, the group struggles to adjust to the avatar changes: Fridge has trouble figuring out how Oberon is even relevant to the game, Spencer's meekness makes him unable to fully utilize Ming's skills, Milo's tendency to 'take the scenic route' when talking makes him unable to relay vital information quickly, and Eddie's hotheaded stubbornness costs the group several lives. Meanwhile, Eddie bickers with Milo, revealing their friendship ended when Milo sold their diner behind Eddie's back, forcing him into retirement. Traveling to a forest beyond the desert, the group crosses a series of rope bridges, while being attacked by a group of mandrills.
                    <br><br>
                    Successfully crossing the bridges, they are reunited with Alex, as his avatar Jefferson "Seaplane" McDonough, and Bethany, who is now Cyclone, a black stallion who can only be understood by Finbar. As they rest from their battle with the mandrills, Eddie realizes Milo is terminally ill and wants to make amends before he dies, so they reconcile.Working together, the group traverses Mt. Zhatmire and finds a river with the same glowing green water, allowing Spencer, Bethany, and Fridge to return in their original avatars Bravestone, Oberon, and Finbar again while Eddie and Milo respectively end up as Ming and Cyclone. Shortly after, Jurgen's men capture Eddie and Milo.
                    <br><br>
                    Spencer, Martha, Fridge, Bethany, and Alex split up to infiltrate the fortress, rescue their teammates and get the Falcon Heart. While scaling the ice wall, Martha asks Spencer why he left his old life and her, and he says her success made him insecure. She consoles him, reminding him we need friends when we feel scared and insecure.There is another battle: Spencer pursues Jurgen to his airship while the others fight his henchmen. Realizing Jurgen is vulnerable to the Jumanji Berry, incapacitates him long enough for Spencer to steal the Falcon Heart necklace and send him plummeting to his death. He then gives Eddie the necklace, and he and Milo fly into the sky, letting the sunlight hit the necklace, restoring the magic and saving the game.
                    <br><br>
                    Returning the Falcon Heart to Nigel, Milo decides to stay behind and protect the land. Upon returning to the real world, Spencer teaches his grandfather about video games. Having gotten over his resentment, Eddie convinces Nora, the owner of his old diner, to hire him as a manager.In a mid-credits scene, a repair man is brought in Spencer's house to repair the furnace, but notices the video game console. Shortly after, several animals stampede outside Nora's, catching the group's attention.</p>
